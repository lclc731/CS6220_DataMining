When k=3, 1 point would be incorrectly classified. See the provided solution for more details.>9 | 10/10 -- Though it's hard and perhaps inconclusive, a Naive Bayes classifier would still generate the "graduate student" prediction.>10 | 10/10>Extra Credit | 5/10 -- Very good idea! I think this would indeed be a good application of association rules.>Speaker Spotlight Series Extra Credit | 5/5>TOTAL: 100/100 -- Great job!> <hr><br>
